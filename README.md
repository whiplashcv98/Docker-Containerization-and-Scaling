# Docker-Containerization-and-Scaling
This project outlines a series of tasks focused on building, managing, and understanding the scaling of applications using Docker. The workflow covers creating a Dockerfile, building a custom image, and discussing advanced concepts like auto-scaling.
Task 1: Create a Project Directory and Container
Each group will create a dedicated project directory on their local machine to organize their files, serving as the context for all subsequent Docker commands.

Task 2: Write a Dockerfile
Groups will write a Dockerfile named azdockerfilegroupname with the following specifications:

Base Image: Use an official base image (e.g., Ubuntu or Alpine).

Dependencies: Install necessary dependencies, such as Python.

Entry Point: Define the image's entry point to execute a basic Python script.

Task 3: Build and Confirm the Image
Using the Docker CLI, groups will build the Docker image from the Dockerfile using the docker build command. The image's functionality will be verified by running a container from it using docker run and checking the output.

Task 4: Install Python in the Container and Commit
If Python was not installed in the Dockerfile, groups will install it inside the running container. Following this, the docker commit command will be used to create a new, updated image from the container's current state.

Task 5: Create an Auto Scaling Group (Optional Advanced Task)
The groups will discuss how they could scale their container solution using AWS Auto Scaling Groups. This task is for discussion only, with no implementation required.

Learnings
This project provides valuable hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of:

Containerization: The process of packaging an application and its dependencies into a single, self-contained unit.

Dockerfile: How a Dockerfile acts as a blueprint for building Docker images.

Docker Commands: Practical experience with core Docker CLI commands (build, run, commit).

Scaling Containers: A conceptual understanding of how to manage and scale containerized applications to handle varying loads.
